### We're very happy to announce the [release](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/releases/tag/v2.1.0)  of Finatra 2.1.0!

There are several improvements and features in this release:

- the ability to "disable" the [TwitterServer HTTP Admin Interface](http://twitter.github.io/twitter-server/Features.html#http-admin-interface) for deploying to environments that only allow binding to a *single* port for your application.
- the ability to "turn-off" automatic JSON body parsing into a case class for requests that represent JSON blobs (useful for document stores).
- Closed issues and pull-requests:

  * https://github.com/twitter/finatra/pull/228
  * https://github.com/twitter/finatra/pull/253
  * https://github.com/twitter/finatra/pull/255
  * https://github.com/twitter/finatra/issues/257
  * https://github.com/twitter/finatra/pull/258
