###  Finatra [Release 2.1.4](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/releases/tag/v2.1.4) is now available from [Maven Central][maven-central].

There are lots of improvements in this release as we focused on making bringing thrift server support to parity with http server support. Please checkout the [v2.1.4](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/releases/tag/v2.1.4) release tag on github for more information.

We've now also documented building thrift servers with Finatra: http://twitter.github.io/finatra/user-guide/build-new-thrift-server/.

As always, you can download the release from [Maven Central][maven-central].
